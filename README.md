# Crafty

A MineCraft clone coded from craft, fully in Rust (without any game engine or any multiplayer framework).

Works best under Linux or Windows. With macos, you can't resize the window...

That works in multiplayer, and with monsters.

And that allows you to craft and to mine !

## In action

Here are some `GIF` to show a little the gameplay... (**In multiplayer !**)

## Current list of features

- **Graphics rendering**
    - We use bindings to **OpenGL** (*glium.rs*) to render all the **cubes**. We are able to render tens-of-thousands of
      cubes using much different optimization.
    - Easy way to import new textures into the game, allowing to easily reproduce minecraft-like landscape.
    - Easy way to presents `Tiles` on the screen (menus) and a custom way to render text. We have implemented **debug
      menu** (`F3`), a **help menu** (`F12`).
- A custom **Game Engine**, featuring
    - **Detection of collision**. This was not a piece of cake. We used **AABB** collision algorithm to solve this
      problem.
    - **Gravity**, Free-Fall, Jumping
    - **Ray tracing** to detect actions with the world and with other players.
- **Minecraft Gameplay**
    - Edition of the world like in minecraft: you can add cubes, collect cubes.
    - A **crafting framework** (press 'E' and you will see for yourself !). Craft a sword to attack your friends.
    - **Items** displayed on the screen, exactly like in Minecraft.
    - An **attack system** with life points for each players.
    - Automatic **monsters** which walk over the world and will try to kill you ! Click `x` when playing to spawn
      monsters, they will fall from the air above you.
- A smart **world creation** system
    - Persistent world: loading and saving the world to the disk by pressing `F10` (singleplayer)
    - Randomized map creation, using **Perlin noise** to have some randomness and with different **biomes** to look
      super beautiful !
    - Different **biomes**
- A **Multiplayer Game** !
    - A **multithreaded TCP server** is in charge of (1) the game logic (map, monsters, etc...) (2) synchronizing all
      players by receiving `MessageToServer` and dispatching `ServerUpdates`
    - An reusable architecture using `Trait` that abstracts to the client (`WorldRenderer`) whether he is in single
      player or in multiplayer.

## Getting started

This project surely still has some bugs and everything, we did mostly over 1 weekend.

But the `main` branch is supposed to run !

### Single Player

To run in **single player**, use:

```console
cargo run --bin crafty --release -- INIT_MODE
```

(*You need to run in release*)

For `INIT_MODE`, you can use

- `--random`: generates a random world using our world creation
- `--flat`  : generates a flat world
- `--disk`  : tries to load the `map.json` on the disk
- If put nothing, will use `--random`

Press `x` to spawn some monsters above you !

### Multi Player

To run in **multiplayer**, first launch a server like this:

```console
cargo run --bin server --release -- --server "YOUR.IP"  --port "PORT" --init random
```

- You need to write your IP address when running the server...
- You don't need to specify which world initializer to use, by default it will be the random one

Then, every client can connect like this:

```console
cargo run --bin client --release -- --server "YOUR.IP" --port "PORT" -- name "UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER"
```

- Each client needs to specify his name, and it needs to be different than the other players.

# Dependencies

The goal of this for-fun side-project was to write a minecraft clone with **as little dependencies** as possible.

The biggest dependency that we use is for a Rust binding of the OpenGL ports called `glium`. This library is
unfortunately not maintained anymore, but hey, our code works with `0.34`.

# Code architecture

The code is divided in 3 libraries and 3 executables

The libraries are

- `model`: defines the model of the game. Itself contains the following modules
    - `game`: model of the game
    - `entity`: model of the entities (players and monsters)
    - `primitves`
    - `collision`: how collisions are handles
    - `server`: model of the server
    - `world`
- `graphics`: defines an implementation of the graphics, using `glium`.
- `network`: defines the network abstraction used for playing with multiple players.

# Roadmap

## Next steps

This project works quite well, but... There is still a lot to do.

### Missing features

- Infinite map creation (*almost there*)

### Problems

- The collision often crashes, and when it happens the consequences are... terrible.
- The multiplayer architecture and implementations should be improved, to support more players. There is a bunch of
  corner cases with multiplayer, most of them are not tracked.
- The UI library is shit, because we have implemented everything ourselves using a dead-library. As a consequence, it
  does not work well with macos and the performances are quite bad. I am not sure to which extent it will be easy to
  create new bindings for another graphics library.

## Crafting recipes (for now)

Stone word:

```
_c_
_c_
_o_
```

where `c` is a cobblestone block, and `o` is an oak log.
