# Cardinal directions
- north / south: along z, with north towards positive z
- east / west: along x, with east towards positive x

A nice mnemonic is to think about the typical way to draw a graph:
```
           ^   north
           |
           |
           |
west       |         east
           |
<----------+---------->
           |
           |
           |
           |
           |
	       v  south
```
